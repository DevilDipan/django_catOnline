## Configuration on New PC

1.	Take any Windows Pc Windows XP or above.
2.	Install Python latest version using the exe file the latest file is python 3.7.3.
3.	Install Pycharm latest the version is 2019.1.
4.	After that we have to install Django on Python it can be done using cmd.
5.	If command prompt(cmd) doesn’t work or recognize those commands, please place the python installation directory in environment          variable inside advance settings in properties.
6.	Then use pip install Django or if this doesn’t work use the snippet I mentioned at the top.
7.	Now if you open this folder it would not run in your pc directly as the location might not be same in this case or so.
8.	So you need to first create a new project then configure the python interpreter to recognize Django using pip (step 6).
9.	Then after you set everything up the last thing to do is of course copy the files of the project except the venv folder.
10.	Go ahead and open the modified project and then type  **Python manage.py runserver** in terminal
